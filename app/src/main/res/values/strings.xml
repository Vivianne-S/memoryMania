    Memory Game Instructions\n\n
    Objective:\n The goal is to match all pairs of cards in the shortest time possible.\n\n
    1. Starting the Game:\n
    • Tap any card to flip it over and reveal the image.\n
    • The timer will automatically start as soon as you flip the first card.\n\n
    2. How to Play:\n
    • Flip two cards at a time to try to find a matching pair.\n
    • If the two cards match, they will stay face up.\n
    • If they do not match, they will flip back over after a short pause, so you can remember their positions.\n\n
    3. Winning the Game:\n
    • The game is complete once all card pairs are matched.\n
    • Your final score is determined by how quickly you find all pairs.\n\n
    4. Timer and Moves:\n
    • The timer at the top of the screen shows how long you’ve been playing.\n
    • Try to find all pairs before the timer reaches a high number!\n\n
    5. Restarting the Game:\n
    • You can press the Reset button at any time to restart the game with a new card arrangement.\n\n
